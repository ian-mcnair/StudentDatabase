# StudentDatabase

## Summary
The files above are all that is needed for the fictitious database application I created for CS415 Design of Databases. The SQL file populates a database with fictitious students, teachers, their schedules and grades, etc. The java files connect to the database as well as create a text interface which navigates the database.
